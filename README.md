- 👋 Hi, I’m @smellycatsrse here with the 
intent of honing my Kali linux skills better  
among other things. If I ever manage to
Release a Linux variant of my own, her name
would certainly be called Ishtar. After 46
Years of studying magic/occult as I have, I would Sex
That Goddess to death,literally. No doubt it would be my demise,
But I would die the most exhausted and happy ape.
Im a PAGAN... but my ideals have modified a lot over 
the last few years . I've seen and done a lot of
unsavory things in my first 3 adult years.
(I was a roadie for rather popular band 
(that you most definitely would know), my touring
stint was 3 years. mostly in east Asia and Europe).
Somehow, as I began to experience various other 
cultures and mystical beliefs, I started to separate
the shit from chaff, so to speak. I and our close friends are 
quite skilled in the Tantric arts, so that DOES make 
one tired if you are doing it right! After the tour I was so
burnt out from that life that I got interested in the
engineering aspect of music. no Mix in the box then,
it was lugging huge reels of tape, but still better
than humping enormous speaker boxes and gaffing  
(taping loose wires on the stage so no one tripped)
Also, in 1983, computers weren't thought of,
and cell phones? WTF were those.  
All you young whippersnappers!
Bred and raised the best kids (Pagans as well).  
Oldest graduated Summa Cum Laude today.
Middle boy is 6'9 450# Safety for Saint Olaf in Minn  (Got a full ride)
Youngest Schooling as social worker, has quite a coven as well.  I'm not so
cool with wicca, but she has her own path to tread.  I hope she'll
end up a Ceremonial magician like her dear old dad.

 learning what.. I've programmed for my own pleasure/needs
all the wa from machine language to Ruby (Don't even mention Fortran!)
- 👀 I’m interested in ... I am a Voice Talent,
 many audiobooks under my belt, tons of spots playing all over the US.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... the ins and outs of KALI, building e-bikes and flying my drones.
 practicing red team vS blue team comps,.I owned a Locksmithing
 business for 10 years in Milwaukee, WI.  I hold an EXTRA class
Amateur radio license (KE9PW) and like to design
my own antenna arrays.
Sorta retired and bought a house in Glenbeulah, WI doing voice-overs still - IF I like the books, and they pay up front.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building anything electronic,
 doing physical penetrations on corporation pen test, and of course, I LOVE the ladies!
